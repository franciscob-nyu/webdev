		<h1>RESPONSE #1</h1>
		<p class="emphasis">Auriea Harvey, a digital artist and sculptor, believes that digital sculpture can play a vital role in shaping the future of art. She emphasizes the importance of using technology to create artwork that reflects contemporary society, offering new possibilities for texture, form, and material that were previously impossible through traditional sculpture techniques. Digital sculpture can also be infinitely replicated and shared, making art more accessible and democratic.</p>
		<p>Harvey does, however, acknowledge the challenges that come with working with digital sculpture, such as the need for specialized software and technical skills. Despite this, she views these challenges as opportunities for artists to collaborate and innovate. Harvey's insights highlight the significance of embracing technology in the art world to explore new avenues of creative expression. With technology continuing to advance, it will be exciting to see how digital sculpture and other forms of digital art will impact the future of art and culture.</p>
